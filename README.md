# School-Automation-System-Project-
This was built during my first year of my BSC IT Degree.
This project is built visual studio using vb.net and was my first programming language that I learnt. Our assignment was that we had to build a school automation system that connects to a databse, updates and retrieves data from a database. The database I'm using is Microsoft Access. I used some SQL quering for database entries and updates.  
The design and layout of the program is exactly the same as what was required.
